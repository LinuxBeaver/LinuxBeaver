Beaver's third party GEGL Plugins for Gimp
=========
Welcome, I make third party GEGL filter plugins for Gimp by chaining GEGL nodes inside c file templates. This allows Gimp to have access to all sorts of cool text styling effects. It will turn your boring bland text into fancy text easy. Please view each filters individual Git page for more info on what each filter can do.

## Windows
Filter binaries go in `C:\Users<YOUR NAME>\AppData\Local\gegl-0.4\plug-ins` then restart Gimp and open GEGL Operations.
  Download for Windows here. But Linux binaries are available in each Github page. Reason Linux doesn't get the 
  same treatment is because it is a taboo for Linux users to get direct binary downloads (especially all in one place).
